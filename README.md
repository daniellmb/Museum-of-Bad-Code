# Museum of Bad Code [{ðŸš«}]

The Museum of Bad Code (MOBC) is the world's only digital museum dedicated to the collection, preservation, exhibition of bad code in all its forms. The mission of the MOBC is to playfully use satire to teach programming anti-patterns that should be avoided.

This free resource empowers developers to learn from the real-world mistakes of others and improve code quality by not making those same errors themselves.

#### Depressed? See the [Museum of Good Code](https://github.com/daniellmb/Museum-of-Good-Code) for some great code!

## [Submit Code](../../issues/new) for inclusion in this museum collection.

### Guidelines

- [Ensure the code has not been submitted already](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue).
- Use a succinct title and isolated code snippet.
- Code should be as anonymous as possible. (It's the Museum of Bad Code not Programmers)
- Bonus points for including refactoring improvements.
