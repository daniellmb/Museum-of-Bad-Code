# Museum of Bad Code

The Museum of Bad Code (MOBC) is the world's only digital museum dedicated to the collection, preservation, exhibition of bad code in all its forms. The mission of the MOBC is to playfully use satire to teach programming anti-patterns that should be avoided.

This free resource empowers developers to learn from the real-world mistakes of others and improve code quality by not making those same errors themselves.
